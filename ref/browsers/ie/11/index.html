    <p>Internet Explorer 11 is featured in Windows 8.1, which was released on October 17, 2013. It includes an incomplete mechanism for syncing tabs. It is a major update to its developer tools,[30][31] enhanced scaling for high DPI screens,[32] HTML5 prerender and prefetch,[33] hardware-accelerated JPEG decoding,[34] closed captioning, HTML5 full screen,[35] and is the first Internet Explorer to support WebGL[36][37][38] and Google's protocol SPDY (starting at v3).[39] This version of IE has features dedicated to Windows 8.1, including cryptography (WebCrypto),[30] adaptive bitrate streaming (Media Source Extensions)[40] and Encrypted Media Extensions.[35]
    </p>
    
    <p>Internet Explorer 11's user agent string now identifies the agent as "Trident" (the underlying layout engine) instead of "MSIE.‚Äù It also announces compatibility with Gecko (the layout engine of Firefox).

    <p>IE11 features redesigned developer tools,[10] support for WebGL,[11] enhanced scaling for high DPI screens,[12] prerender and prefetch.[13] After launch IE11 got support for HTTP/2.[14][15][16] In addition, IE11 supports Full Screen and Orientation APIs, CSS border image support, JavaScript enhancements, DOM mutation observers, Web Cryptography API, video text track support, encrypted media support and an improved HTML editor.[17] IE11 uses Transport Layer Security v1.2 as the default protocol for secure connections and deprecates RC4 cipher suite.[18]</p>

    <h2>Standards Support</h2>

    <p>Internet Explorer, using the Trident layout engine:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supports HTML 4.01, parts of HTML5, CSS Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, XML 1.0, and DOM Level 1, with minor implementation gaps.
</li>
      <li>Fully supports XSLT 1.0 as well as an obsolete Microsoft dialect of XSLT often referred to as WD-xsl, which was loosely based on the December 1998 W3C Working Draft of XSL. Support for XSLT 2.0 lies in the future: semi-official Microsoft bloggers have indicated that development is underway, but no dates have been announced.
</li>

      <li>Almost full conformance to CSS 2.1 has been added in the Internet Explorer 8 release.[53][54] The trident rendering engine in Internet Explorer 9 in 2011, scored highest in the official W3C conformance test suite for CSS 2.1 of all major browsers.
</li>

      <li>Supports XHTML in Internet Explorer 9 (Trident version 5.0). Prior versions can render XHTML documents authored with HTML compatibility principles and served with a text/html MIME-type.
</li>

      <li>Supports a subset[55] of SVG in Internet Explorer 9 (Trident version 5.0), excluding SMIL, SVG fonts and filters.
</li>
    </ul>
