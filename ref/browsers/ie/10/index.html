    <p>Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) is the tenth version of the Internet Explorer web browser, released by Microsoft on September 4, 2012 along with Windows Server 2012. IE10 was included with the release of Windows 8 on October 26, 2012. IE10 was released for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 on February 26, 2013.</p>    

    <p>IE10 expands on Internet Explorer 9 functionality with regard to CSS3 support, hardware acceleration,[4] and HTML5 support. On Windows 8, it is divided into two editions with different user interfaces: a Metro app that does not support plug-ins and a traditional desktop application that retains plug-in support.[5] On 64-bit computers, the Metro edition runs in 64-bit mode by default.[6] The desktop edition can be run in 64-bit mode by enabling Enhanced Protected Mode.[7] Internet Explorer 10 was the last version to be called Windows Internet Explorer; the software was rebranded as just Internet Explorer from Internet Explorer 11 onward.</p>

    <h2>Standards Support</h2>

    <p>Internet Explorer, using the Trident layout engine:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supports HTML 4.01, parts of HTML5, CSS Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, XML 1.0, and DOM Level 1, with minor implementation gaps.
</li>
      <li>Fully supports XSLT 1.0 as well as an obsolete Microsoft dialect of XSLT often referred to as WD-xsl, which was loosely based on the December 1998 W3C Working Draft of XSL. Support for XSLT 2.0 lies in the future: semi-official Microsoft bloggers have indicated that development is underway, but no dates have been announced.
</li>

      <li>Almost full conformance to CSS 2.1 has been added in the Internet Explorer 8 release.[53][54] The trident rendering engine in Internet Explorer 9 in 2011, scored highest in the official W3C conformance test suite for CSS 2.1 of all major browsers.
</li>

      <li>Supports XHTML in Internet Explorer 9 (Trident version 5.0). Prior versions can render XHTML documents authored with HTML compatibility principles and served with a text/html MIME-type.
</li>

      <li>Supports a subset[55] of SVG in Internet Explorer 9 (Trident version 5.0), excluding SMIL, SVG fonts and filters.
</li>
    </ul>
