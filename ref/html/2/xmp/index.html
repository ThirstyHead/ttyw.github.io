    <h1>Xmp</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">5.5.2.1. Example and Listing: XMP, LISTING</a></h2>
    <p>[DEPRECATED]</p>
    <p>[since: HTML 2.x]</p>
    <p>[source: RFC 1866, published November 1995, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt</a>]</p>

    <p>
The &lt;XMP&gt; and &lt;LISTING&gt; elements are similar to the &lt;PRE&gt; element,
   but they have a different syntax. Their content is declared as CDATA,
   which means that no markup except the end-tag open delimiter-in-
   context is recognized (see 9.6 "Delimiter Recognition" of [SGML]).
    </p>

    <p>
    NOTE - In a previous draft of the HTML specification, the syntax
      of &lt;XMP&gt; and &lt;LISTING&gt; elements allowed closing tags to be treated
      as data characters, as long as the tag name was not &lt;XMP&gt; or
      &lt;LISTING&gt;, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
Since CDATA declared content has a number of unfortunate interactions
   with processing techniques and tends to be used and implemented
   inconsistently, HTML documents should not contain &lt;XMP&gt; nor &lt;LISTING&gt;
   elements -- the &lt;PRE&gt; tag is more expressive and more consistently
   supported.
    </p>

    <p>
    The &lt;LISTING&gt; element should be rendered so that at least 132
   characters fit on a line. The &lt;XMP&gt; element should be rendered so
   that at least 80 characters fit on a line but is otherwise identical
   to the &lt;LISTING&gt; element.
    </p>

    <p>
NOTE - In a previous draft, HTML included a &lt;PLAINTEXT&gt; element
      that is similar to the &lt;LISTING&gt; element, except that there is no
      closing tag: all characters after the &lt;PLAINTEXT&gt; start-tag are
      data.
