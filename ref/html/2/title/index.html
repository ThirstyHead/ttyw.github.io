    <h1>Title</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">5.2.1. Title: TITLE</a></h2>
    <p>[since: HTML 2.x]</p>
    <p>[source: RFC 1866, published November 1995, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt</a>]</p>

    <p>
Every HTML document must contain a &lt;TITLE&gt; element.
    </p>

    <p>The title should identify the contents of the document in a global
   context. A short title, such as "Introduction" may be meaningless out
   of context. A title such as "Introduction to HTML Elements" is more
   appropriate.</p>

    <p>NOTE - The length of a title is not limited; however, long titles
      may be truncated in some applications. To minimize this
      possibility, titles should be fewer than 64 characters.</p>

    <p>A user agent may display the title of a document in a history list or
   as a label for the window displaying the document. This differs from
   headings (5.4, "Headings: H1 ... H6"), which are typically displayed
   within the body text flow.</p>
