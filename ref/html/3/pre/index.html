    </code></pre>

    <p>The PRE element can be used to include preformatted text. User agents render this in a fixed pitch font, preserving spacing associated with white space characters such as space and newline characters. Automatic word-wrap should be disabled within PRE elements. </p>

    <p>Note that the SGML standard requires that the parser remove a newline immediately following the start tag or immediately preceding the end tag. </p>

    <p>PRE has the same content model as paragraphs, excluding images and elements that produce changes in font size, e.g. IMG, BIG, SMALL, SUB, SUP and FONT. </p>

    <p>A few user agents support the WIDTH attribute. It provides a hint to the user agent of the required width in characters. The user agent can use this to select an appropriate font size or to indent the content appropriately. </p>

    <p>Here is an example of a PRE element; a verse from Shelley (To a Skylark): </p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;PRE&gt;
       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
    And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
    &lt;/PRE&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>which is rendered as:</p>

    <pre>
       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
    And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
    </pre>

    <p>The horizontal tab character (encoded in Unicode, US ASCII and ISO 8859-1 as decimal 9) should be interpreted as the smallest non-zero number of spaces which will leave the number of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is strongly discouraged since it is common practice when editing to set the tab-spacing to other values, leading to misaligned documents. </p>
