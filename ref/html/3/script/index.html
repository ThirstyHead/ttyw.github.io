    <p>[since: HTML 3.x]</p>
    <p>[source: HTML 3.2 Reference Specification, published January 1997, <a         href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/SPSD-html32-20180315/">https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/    SPSD-html32-20180315/</a>]</p>
   
    <pre><code>
    &lt;!ELEMENT STYLE  - - CDATA -- placeholder for style info --&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT SCRIPT - - CDATA -- placeholder for script statements --&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>
These are place holders for the introduction of style sheets and client-side scripts in future versions of HTML. User agents should hide the contents of these elements. 
    </p>

    <p>
These elements are defined with CDATA as the content type. As a result they may contain only SGML characters. All markup characters or delimiters are ignored and passed as data to the application, except for ETAGO ("&lt;/") delimiters followed immediately by a name character [a-zA-Z]. This means that the element's end-tag (or that of an element in which it is nested) is recognized, while an error occurs if the ETAGO is invalid.
