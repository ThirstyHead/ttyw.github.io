    <h2><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-MENU">10.4 The DIR and MENU elements</a></h2>
    <p>[DEPRECATED]</p>
    <p>[since: HTML 2.x]</p>
    <p>[source: HTML 4.01 Specification, published December 1999, <a         href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/</a>]</p>
   
    <p>DIR and MENU are deprecated.</p>

    <p>The DIR element was designed to be used for creating multicolumn directory lists. The MENU element was designed to be used for single column menu lists. Both elements have the same structure as UL, just different rendering. In practice, a user agent will render a DIR or MENU list exactly as a UL list.</p>

    <p>We strongly recommend using UL instead of these elements.</p>
