    <h2><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">5.7.3. Anchor: A
</a></h2>
    <p>[since: HTML 2.x]</p>
    <p>[source: RFC 1866, published November 1995, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt</a>]</p>

    <p>
 The &lt;A&gt; element indicates a hyperlink anchor (see 7, "Hyperlinks").
   At least one of the NAME and HREF attributes should be present.
   Attributes of the &lt;A&gt; element:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>HREF</dt>
      <dd>gives the URI of the head anchor of a hyperlink.</dd>

      <dt>NAME</dt>
      <dd>gives the name of the anchor, and makes it available as
            a head of a hyperlink.</dd>

      <dt>TITLE</dt>
      <dd>suggests a title for the destination resource --
            advisory only. The TITLE attribute may be used:
            <ul>
              <li>for display prior to accessing the destination
                resource, for example, as a margin note or on a
                small box while the mouse is over the anchor, or
                while the document is being loaded;</li>
              <li>for resources that do not include a title, such as
                graphics, plain text and Gopher menus, for use as a
                window title.</li>
            </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>REL</dt>
      <dd>The REL attribute gives the relationship(s) described by
            the hyperlink. The value is a whitespace separated list
            of relationship names. The semantics of link
            relationships are not specified in this document.</dd>

      <dt>REV</dt>
      <dd>same as the REL attribute, but the semantics of the
            relationship are in the reverse direction. A link from A
            to B with REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a
            link from B to A with REV="X". An anchor may have both
            REL and REV attributes.</dd>

      <dt>URN</dt>
      <dd>specifies a preferred, more persistent identifier for
            the head anchor of the hyperlink. The syntax and 
            semantics of the URN attribute are not yet specified.
      </dd>

      <dt>METHODS</dt>
      <dd>specifies methods to be used in accessing the
            destination, as a whitespace-separated list of names.
            The set of applicable names is a function of the scheme
            of the URI in the HREF attribute. For similar reasons as
            for the TITLE attribute, it may be useful to include the
            information in advance in the link. For example, the
            HTML user agent may chose a different rendering as a
            function of the methods allowed; for example, something
            that is searchable may get a different icon.</dd>
