  <!--
    Teach your children well
    Their father's hell
    Did slowly go by

    And feed them on your dreams
    The ones they pick
    The ones you'll know by

    Don't you ever ask them, "Why?"
    If they told you, you would cry
    So just look at them and sigh
    And know they love you...
    
    - "Teach Your Children" Crosby, Stills, and Nash
