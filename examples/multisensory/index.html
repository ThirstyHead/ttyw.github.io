    And in the naked light I saw
    Ten thousand people, maybe more
    People talking without speaking
    People hearing without listening
    People writing songs that voices never share
    And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

    "The Sound of Silence" Simon and Garfunkel

        <h1>Multisensory Architecture: Design Beyond Vision</h1>

        <p>Gartner, Inc. says that over 30% of our computer interactions these days are through voice rather than touch, mouse, or keyboard. ("Hey Alexa, can you verify that for me?") <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3956009">They go on to say</a>, "Conversational user interface technology is fundamentally shifting how technology providers build and how people use software and applications. Product managers developing software solutions must add conversational UI into their product roadmaps in the next two years for relevant use cases."</p>

        <p>In this workshop, <a href="https://thirstyhead.com">Scott Davis</a> (<a          href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/scott-davis">Web Architect and Developer        Advocate, ThoughtWorks</a>) introduces you to W3C specifications like the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/">Web Speech API</a> (for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">speech synthesis</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition">speech recognition</a>), <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a> (SSML), and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/">WebVTT</a> (for closed captioning). These technologies not only power smart speakers from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple; they power <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis">smartphones and desktop browsers</a> as well.</p>

        <p>With the recent passage of the <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/03/22/european-accessibility-act-eaa/">European Accessibility Act</a> (EAA), all new and existing websites in the EU must meet W3C standards for accessibility (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> AA-level) by <a href="https://www.deque.com/blog/eu-web-accessibility-compliance-and-legislation/">September, 2020</a>. So, while you are setting yourself up for future success with your Conversational UI architecture, you are also helping your company avoid lawsuits (<a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2019/07/federal-ada-title-iii-lawsuit-numbers-continue-to-climb-in-2019/">over 10,000 Americans with Disabilities Act cases</a> in 2019 alone), improving your SEO, and tapping into an underserved market (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html">1 in 4 people in the US</a>, over <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability">1 billion people worldwide</a>) with an estimated market value of over <a href="https://qz.com/work/1703963/businesses-should-pay-attention-to-consumers-with-disabilities/">$8 trillion dollars in discretionary spending</a>.</p>
