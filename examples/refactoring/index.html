        <h1>Web Refactoring into Testability</h1>
        <p>In his book <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)">Martin Fowler</a> gives a simple, compelling definition of the word: "noun: a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior". The examples in the book are written in JavaScript and Java. Can the same principles be applied to web development?</p>

        <p>In this workshop, <a href="https://thirstyhead.com">Scott Davis</a> (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/scott-davis">Web Architect and Developer Advocate, ThoughtWorks</a>) brings the engineering rigor of Refactoring to an existing, perfectly functional website called <a href="https://thirstyhead.com/groceryworks/">GroceryWorks</a>-- a website that works now, but might give anyone pause if they were tasked with adding some new functionality to it. The website is what Scott affectionately calls "20th Century Idiomatic" -- "page-centric" if one is feeling charitable; "monolithic" and "pathologically global" if less so. </p>

        <p>Join Scott as he brings 21st Century web development practices and programming to the "internal structure" of the website -- web components and custom events; templates and shadow DOM; -- and modern testing tools -- <a href="https://gauge.org/">Gauge</a> and <a href="https://taiko.dev">Taiko</a> -- that "make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior". </p>
