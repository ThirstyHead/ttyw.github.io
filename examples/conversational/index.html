    And in the naked light I saw
    Ten thousand people, maybe more
    People talking without speaking
    People hearing without listening
    People writing songs that voices never share
    And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

    <meta name="description" content="In this workshop, Scott Davis helps you unlock the Conversational UI that is already in your app or website. We'll discuss the semantics of HTML and the Accessibility (including text-to-speech) baked into every modern browser, desktop or mobile. We'll add JavaScript-based speech synthesis to your app in two lines of code. For more sophisticated speech, we'll explore SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) -- the markup language used by Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and others. We'll leverage the Speech Recognition available to you in your browser, so that you can talk to your browser. And finally, we'll add closed captions to your videos, and transcripts to your podcasts to help with Search Engine Optimization and rounding out your Accessibility capabilities.">

        <h1>Unlocking the Conversation in Your App</h1>
        <p>Your web browser doesn't have a cute name like Alexa, Siri, or Cortana, but it can be just as talkative. Your smartphone, with a built-in speaker and microphone, is a perfect device for building a standards-based, browser-native, framework-free Conversational UI using nothing but W3C specifications like the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/">Web Speech API</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)</a>.</p>

        <p>In this workshop, <a href="https://thirstyhead.com">Scott Davis</a> (<a          href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/scott-davis">Web Architect and Developer        Advocate, ThoughtWorks</a>) helps you unlock the Conversational UI that is already in your app or website. 
        <ul>
          <li>We'll discuss the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/introduction.html#introduction">semantics of HTML</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">Accessibility</a> (including text-to-speech) baked into every modern browser, desktop or mobile. </li>
          <li>We'll add JavaScript-based <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/#tts-section">SpeechSynthesis</a> to your app in two lines of code. </li>

          <li>And finally, we'll add closed captions to your videos (using <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/">WebVTT</a>) and transcripts to your podcasts to help with Search Engine Optimization and making the Accessibility of your web app more robust.</li>
