        <h1>ConferenceWorks: A Real Website for a Fictional Software Conference</h1>
        <p>Software conferences are a great way to keep up on trends in modern software development. Building a website for a fictional software conference using browser-native HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to experience framework-free, standards-based web development.</p>    
        <p>You can start at the <a href="conclusion/">Conclusion</a> to see the finished website, or begin at the <a href="introduction/">Introduction</a> to build it up, step-by-step.</p>
